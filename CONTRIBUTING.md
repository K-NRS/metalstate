## Project Philosophy and Guidelines

The fundamental philosophy of MetalState is to provide a minimal and simple state management solution. The core tenet of this philosophy is that accessing and manipulating data should be as easy as using `useState` in React.

I aim to offer the smallest, most practical, and extendible state management library that can be used in any React application. With that in mind, contributions should honor this philosophy by maintaining simplicity, minimalism, and extendibility.

Here are some guidelines to keep in mind when contributing:

- **Simplicity**: The API should be small and easy to understand. Avoid adding unnecessary complexity.
- **Consistency**: Coding style, file structure, and API naming should be consistent throughout the project.
- **Testability**: Code should be written in a way that makes it easy to test. Always write tests for new features or bug fixes.
- **Documentation**: If your changes alter the API or add new features, please also add or update the relevant documentation.

By contributing to the project, you acknowledge that you've read and understand the philosophy and guidelines of the project.

Again, thanks for contributing. Your effort is highly appreciated!
