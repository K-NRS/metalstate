<div align='center'>
ðŸª¨ MetalState is extra-ordinarily minimal and extendible, global state store for React and compatible with NextJS 13+.

<br />

> The philosophy of `ðŸª¨ MetalState` is to make data access as easy as using `useState`. Therefore, it provides the smallest and most minimal form for storing and managing states globally!
